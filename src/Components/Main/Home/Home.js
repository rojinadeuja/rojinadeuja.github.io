                <strong>Hello! I am Rojina Deuja, a MSCS student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)</strong>, working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for courses closely related to Data and Software Engineering.

            <p>
                I am working with Dr. Mohammad Rashedul Hasan on Natural Language Processing, exploring ways to handle enterprise-level data to understand customers and improve businesses. My goal is to relay the knowledge and experiences I have gathered working with multiple businesses into creating innovative and intelligent software solutions.

            <p>
                <strong>I have a strong programming background.</strong> I enjoy learning new things and can assimilate new ideas quickly. My ideal job would be a Full-stack Software Developer. <strong>I am currently looking for Summer 2021 internships!</strong>
